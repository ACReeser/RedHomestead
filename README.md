**_IMPORTANT_**

This repo does NOT contain all the files required to build RedHomestead. Install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) first **before opening the project folder in Unity**, and you'll need to import packages and asset store assets.

##Standard Asset packages
Standard Assets are not included in this repository, and will need to be imported on each machine that intends to build from the source. The following packages are used:

 1. Characters
 2. ParticleSystems
 3. Vehicles
 
Standard Assets are installed from Assets > Import Package

##Assets from Asset Store

The following assets will need to be added from the Asset store, since they are not source controlled:

 1. [Scifi Crate](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/21965)
 2. [Yughues Free Stylized Foliages](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13392)
 
##Blender

Most models are native .blend files, and have not been exported to FBX (yet). In order for Unity to render them, [Blender must be installed](https://www.blender.org/download/). If you open Unity before installing Blender, each model needs to be reimported.
