Polyetheylene production:
/// https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/56ldqj/what_does_packing_for_mars_look_like_mass/
/// First, let me explain how simple PE is. It's basically three steps: electrolysis of water for hydrogen, then atmosphere + hydrogen + energy => ethylene. Add titanium(III) chloride or similar catalyst and tada, polyethylene. It isn't much more difficult than the sabatier reaction that produces methane.

Efficiency and Power Usage:
Electrolysis of Water:
Maximum theoretical efficiency 100%: 39.4 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of hydrogen, 12,749 joules per litre (and half as much Oxygen product)
Alkaline catalysts: 43-67% efficient. call it 50%
PEM catalysts: 65 - 70%; call it 70%
additional electrical efficiency when paired with thermal input - maybe 15%?
this is interesting when paired with sabatier reactor which releases heat

Sabatier only requires large electrical power on cold start

Integrate Sabatier/RWGS: 
An optimized IMISPPS is projected to produce 1 kg/day of O2:CH4 propellant and have a mass of 50 kg with a methane purity of 98+% while consuming 700 W of electrical power.
