Polyetheylene production:
/// https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/56ldqj/what_does_packing_for_mars_look_like_mass/
/// First, let me explain how simple PE is. It's basically three steps: electrolysis of water for hydrogen, then atmosphere + hydrogen + energy => ethylene. Add titanium(III) chloride or similar catalyst and tada, polyethylene. It isn't much more difficult than the sabatier reaction that produces methane.

Efficiency and Power Usage:
Electrolysis of Water:
Maximum theoretical efficiency 100%: 39.4 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of hydrogen, 12,749 joules per litre (and half as much Oxygen product)
Alkaline catalysts: 43-67% efficient. call it 50%
PEM catalysts: 65 - 70%; call it 70%
additional electrical efficiency when paired with thermal input - maybe 15%?
this is interesting when paired with sabatier reactor which releases heat

Sabatier only requires large electrical power on cold start

Integrate Sabatier/RWGS: 
An optimized IMISPPS is projected to produce 1 kg/day of O2:CH4 propellant and have a mass of 50 kg with a methane purity of 98+% while consuming 700 W of electrical power.

players aren't interested in combat, it really means that this game isn't built for it thematically
players are interested in seeing npc colonists wander around, and having much more detailed survival mechanics/gameplay
early/midgame quests and voice-comm backstory are both in line with existing features and gives a lot of oomph
exploration as a feature lacks a lot of agency if encounter sites are lifeless
