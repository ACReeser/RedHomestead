Efficiency and Power Usage:
Electrolysis of Water:
Maximum theoretical efficiency 100%: 39.4 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of hydrogen, 12,749 joules per litre (and half as much Oxygen product)
Alkaline catalysts: 43-67% efficient. call it 50%
PEM catalysts: 65 - 70%; call it 70%
additional electrical efficiency when paired with thermal input - maybe 15%?
this is interesting when paired with sabatier reactor which releases heat

Sabatier only requires large electrical power on cold start

Integrate Sabatier/RWGS: 
An optimized IMISPPS is projected to produce 1 kg/day of O2:CH4 propellant and have a mass of 50 kg with a methane purity of 98+% while consuming 700 W of electrical power.
